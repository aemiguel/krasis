  Generated output (64 tokens):
    <think>
    Okay, I need to write a poem about recursion in programming. Hmm, recursion is when a function calls itself, right? So the poem should explain that concept in a creative way. Let me start by thinking of metaphors or imagery that represent recursion.
    
    Maybe like peeling an onion, layers upon layers?
